[^fn00002]: *Note on transliteration*: The article uses a somewhat unconventional transliteration system, which was developed to facilitate computational analysis. Unlike more traditional transliteration schemes the current one uses one-to-one letter representation, with every Arabic letter transcribed distinctively, which allows for an automatic conversion between transliteration and the Arabic script. The overall scheme should be easily recognizable to Arabists (new letters are as follows: *ŧ* for *tāʾ marbūṭaŧ*; *ã* for dagger *alif*; and *á* for *alif maqṣūraŧ*). Additionally, all attached conjunctions, prepositions, pronominal suffixes are separated with “-”. Whenever applicable, toponyms are given in their current American spelling. Bibliographical references and quotations preserve their original transliteration schemes.

With at least 40,000 unique titles identifiable for the period before 1900 CE (*see below*), the Arabic written tradition is one of the greatest treasuries of knowledge in human history. Covering practically every aspect of Islamic culture, this tradition is particularly rich in extensive historical sources such as chronicles and biographical collections. Numbered in the hundreds, these multivolume texts cover practically every aspect of Islamic history and culture: from conquests, dynastic vicissitudes, and urban unrest, to food prices, long-distance trade, plagues, and natural disasters, as well as practically anything imaginable in between. The overall volume of individual titles is often equally astonishing. One of the largest surviving texts, “The History of Islam” (_Taʾrīḫ al-islām_) of al-Ḏahabī, a 14^th^-century Damascene scholar, is a mammoth of Arabic biographical literature that covers seven centuries of Islamic history (*c.* 600–1300 CE) through over 30,000 biographies and about 10,000 descriptions of historical events—spanning over 50 volumes (\~3,4 million words) in one of its modern editions.[@DhahabiTi1990tadmuri] The overall number of biographical records in texts that are currently available digitally already exceeds 400,000. Together these narrative sources make up the richest gold mine of information on Islamic history and culture, and they are particularly important for the period prior to the 15^th^ century, for which very few primary documents and archives are available.

For decades, scholars of Islamic history have recognized the value of these sources. The potential of the quantitative approach to these sources has been conceptualized and demonstrated by several scholars of Islamic history who worked independently in different countries in the 1970s and 1980s.[See, @BullietQuantitative1970, @ProzorovPrinciples2003] However, the excessive volume of even individual titles posed a formidable challenge. Previous attempts to study Arabic historical sources relied on the use of mechanically sortable index cards, punch cards, early computers that stored data on magnetic tapes, and, most recently, relational databases. None of these approaches, however, allowed one to surpass the bottleneck of data extraction and processing, and the methods remained extremely time consuming. The number of data-driven studies is still small, and the potential of the approach has not been realized.[For a detailed discussion of previous approaches to biographical data in Arabic and Islamic studies, see @RomanovComputational2013, pp. 51–58.] The unfathomable Arabic biographical and historical texts became “both a blessing and a curse”.

This remains largely the status quo, but the recent digital turn offers new opportunities. In the course of the past decade thousands of premodern Islamic texts have become available in full-text digital formats through a number of online open-access libraries, while at the same time rapid development of computational methods of text analysis has provided a number of novel approaches for studying large textual corpora. These two developments help to overcome the main limitations of conventional quantitative historical studies and take full advantage of the information trapped in these voluminous texts. First, modern computers make data extraction fast, scalable, and flexible; second, computational methods of text analysis allow one to maintain solid connections between collected quantifiable data and full-text passages that deal with specific instances, and thus bring together quantitative and qualitative dimensions of analysis—or, in other words, distant and close reading.

![An iterative nature of algorithmic analysis](./images/aa_process.png){#fig:aa_process}

The focus of the current article is on the method of algorithmic analysis of Arabic biographical collections. What is understood here by algorithmic analysis is a step-by-step reduction of a text in a natural language to a machine-readable abstraction which is then followed by the analysis of shapes, relations and structures.[^fn00003] More generally, algorithmic analysis can be viewed—shown on Figure {@fig:aa_process}—as an iterative process of engagement with texts, their abstractions, and their interpretations, where preliminary results of later steps of the loop can suggest one how to improve earlier steps to attain better results. Although my focus here is on this particular genre, similar approaches can be applied to any type of text in any language as long as it displays some internal regularity that can be identified and exploited for the reduction of the initial text to a machine-readable abstraction. It should be noted, however, that it will be most effective for extensive collections of information units with similar internal structure. In the context of the Arabic written tradition, this method can be used most effectively with lexicographical dictionaries, collections of legal decisions (sing. *fatwá*), gazetteers, comprehensive geographies, interpretations of the Qurʾān, collections of the sayings of the Prophet (Ḥadīṯ), bibliographies, and other dictionary-like texts.

[^fn00003]: I found Stephen Ramsay’s notion of “algorithmic criticism” particularly inspiring for my thinking about algorithmic analysis. See, [@RamsayReading2011]. Franco Morretti’s and Matthew Jockers’s work has been equally thought provoking and inspiring: [@MorettiGraphs2007, @MorettiDistant2013, @JockersMacroanalysis2013]. The method was first presented several years ago when it was at the very early stage of development as a part of a dissertation project, where it was then first implemented: see, [@RomanovComputational2013]. This article offers an overview of the method in its most recent form and describes relevant ongoing work aimed at scaling up the approach. See, [@RomanovTDH2014]. This publication summarizes the state of the method at 2012.
